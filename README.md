# Face_recognition
Recognizes and matches faces in real time.

Uses a pre trained model ([face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)) to identify and match faces according to given datasets in form of jpg files.

To register your face just put a .jpg file containing your face in good lighting in the Faces folder and rename the file as your name. Then the program will be able to recognise you when you show your face infront of your webcam in good lighting conditions.

Make sure you install all the dependencies before you run the program (See the import statements in the Face.py file).
